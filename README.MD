# Do I need an Umbrella
## WIP

Website that tells you if you need an umbrella and sends you a daily notification to remind you

## Objective:

* Create a full stack website that checks https://openweathermap.org and tells the user if they should take an umbrella with them today
* Use node && typescript && react
* Have tests (and lining)
* Have UI tests
* Have a pipeline for it
* Use a TDD approach
