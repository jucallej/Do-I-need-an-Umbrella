## WIP

Website that tells you if you need an umbrella and sends you a daily notification to remind you

### Objective:

* Create a full stack website that checks OpenWeatherMap and tells the user if they should take an umbrella with them that day
* Use node && typescript && react
* Have tests (and linting)
* Have UI tests
* Have a pipeline for it
* Use a TDD approach
* Run it somewhere
